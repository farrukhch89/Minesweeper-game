4) Implement methods to place 20 mines randomly in the minefield and render the mines when a

foreground.

5) Modify the touch behaviour to stop accepting input when a mine is uncovered. It should only
reenable input when the user has clicked the reset button.
(70%)
6) The other button should switch between displaying “uncover mode” or “marking mode” each
time it is clicked. In uncover mode each touch should result in a cell being uncovered. In marking
mode each time a covered cell is touched, it should change to yellow to denote it is marked or
back to black, to denote it is unmarked. Use the two text fields to denote the total number of
mines and the number of mines marked. In uncover mode, touching a marked cell should do
nothing.
